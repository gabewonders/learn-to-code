# Learn to Code Series
The Learn to Code Series is a way to promote programming, coding, developing, geeking out whatever you may call it. Coding is a powerful tool and has endless possibilities. Anyone can learn to code. These series are meant for everyone: beginners, experts and those who have never read a line of code in their life. In our opinion, the best way to learn is by doing. Our goal is to provide hands on experience and provide you with the skills to create something amazing. Our format will consist of at least two sessions on the same subject. The first session will be an introduction to the topic the following sessions will be workshops where we will build applications together. Happy Coding!
